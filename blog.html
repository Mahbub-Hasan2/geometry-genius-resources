                DOM stands for Document Object Model, an interface that represents the content of an HTML or document.

                <br><br>
                This interface is a collection of objects, actions, attributes, and relationships, which is collectively
                known as an object model.
                <br><br>
                DOM provides developers with a language-independent application programming interface for accessing and
                manipulating documents.
                <br><br>
                The resulting documents can be dynamic like a web app or static like a read-only page
                <br>

            DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming api for your HTML (or XML) documents. It is an object
            representing parsed code of your page.
            <br><br>
            It has a tree-like structure that allows you to traverse, access and modify its nodes.

            <p class="text-gray-600 pl-5">What is the Dom and what is the purpose of DomWhat Event Bubbling and Event
                Capturing are two phases of event propagation/flow in Javascript. Event flow is basically the order in
                which the events are received on a web page. In Javascript, event flow takes place in three phases -

                Capture Phase
                Target Phase
                Bubble Phase </p>

                Ans. A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished
                execution.

                Below is an example of a simple callback function that logs to the console after some operations have
                been completed.
